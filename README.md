# Nuxt 3 + Prisma Full Stack App.

This is an example setup of Nuxt 3 with Prisma ORM. I created this example application to demonstrate how Vue 3 can be used as a fullstack application.

- Front End Template.
- JSON API expose data for requests.
- Prisma ORM to connect to the database and manage models.
